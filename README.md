# CardioCare

Developed as part of Intel Python HACKFURY2

## Overview of project

Cardiovascular diseases, are among the most widespread and costly health problems faced by the nation today. It is critical to address the risk factors as early as possible to prevent potential complications of chronic cardiovascular diseases. Consulting a cardiologist is expensive for citizens below poverty line.
Being undergraduates who would be specializing in Biomedical Design in our dual degree programme, we chose this project to provide a solution that would :
- be an easy-to-use application 
- which can be used by general physicians to receive ML-based diagnosis with high accuracy
- positively help to warn patients of any impending heart disease complications, well in advance. 
- help control the risk factors for possible cardiovascular diseases.

The deployed app uses Intel Distribution for Python and the optimized scikit-learn and numpy packages. We hope to explore more Intel products for data analytics like the DAAL library for the final product. 

We aspire to collaborate with a cardiology-based hospital or medical institute, use their larger database and datasets and utilize Intel Optimization for Tensorflow to create a much more accurate model using neural networks. This would definitely help us in widening the capability of our model to predict disease and disease risk of the patient along with the expertise of the cardiologist.
